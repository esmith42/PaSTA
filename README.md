# PaSTA
This package was built to help with the analysis of arrival time of P and S waves from earthquakes. It is my the final project for my Scientific Computing in Astrophysics class in Fall 2021.

This package was specifically built to perform the type of analysis carried out in [Menke et al's paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL070918), specifically, where they plot the S and P wave time residuals against each other and measure the slope of the best-fit line. This package also has a couple extra features (TX curve and waveform plotting) that should be useful to body wave seismologists.

The acronym stands for P And S wave Time Analysis (PASTA!).

This package would not have been possible without the help of Professor Maureen Long and her student Yantao Luo of Yale University. Thank you to both of them!


# Installation
To install, download the zip file from the main github page, unzip the file, cd into the directory, and do 'pip install .'

# Data Acquisition


# Data Analysis

# Plotting

# Example Data
Since the data acquisition script takes a long time to run (owing to its need to communicate with the IRIS server), I have provided a folder with example data of five events measured by stations in the central Appalachian region between 2017 and 2019.
