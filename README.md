# PaSTA
ASTR 330 final project

This package was built to help with the analysis of arrival time of P and S waves from earthquakes. It is my the final project for my Scientific Computing in Astrophysics class in Fall 2021.

The acronym stands for P And S wave Time Analysis (PASTA!).

To install, download the zip file from the main github page, unzip the file, cd into the directory, and do 'pip install .'
